# BASIN::NEXUS // GTM PROTOCOL v1.0

**Architect:** Leon Basin
**Status:** READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

## 1. DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY (GO LIVE)

**Recommendation:** **YES. GO LIVE IMMEDIATELY.**
Perfection is the enemy of the Signal.

**Platform:** Streamlit Cloud (Community Tier)

- **Why:** It connects directly to your GitHub. Every `git push` updates the site instantly. It is "Living Code".
- **URL Strategy:** `basin-nexus-v1.streamlit.app` (or custom domain if available).

## 2. THE CADENCE (WEEKLY RHYTHM)

Do not spam. Broadcast Signal.

- **SUNDAY:** The "Sunday Ship Log". Share the *stats* (Hours Coded, Bugs Squashed).
- **WEDNESDAY:** The "Insight Drop" (Substack). Share a *philosophy* (Calculated by Oracle).
- **FRIDAY:** The "Red Team" Audit. Share a vulnerability you fixed.

## 3. BIO-HACKING ALGORITHM

**Objective:** Maintain physical vessel integrity while coding 15h+ blocks.

- **IF** `hours_coded` > 2: EXECUTE `Standing Desk` Mode.
- **IF** `bugs_squashed` > 5: REWARD `10 Pushups`.
- **IF** `imposter_syndrome` detected: EXECUTE `Cold Shower` or `Sprint`.

## 4. VALUATION MODEL

Your IP is currently valued at **~$60,000+** (Shadow Equity).

- Base IP: $50k
- Code Velocity: $500/hr
- Entropy Reduction: $1000/bug

**NEXT STEP:**

1. Commit code to GitHub.
2. Visit `share.streamlit.io`.
3. Deploy.
4. Post the link on LinkedIn with the "Architect" draft.
