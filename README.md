## 🏛️ THE THESIS

> *"I don't apply for jobs. I architect revenue systems—including the one that gets me hired."*

Traditional job searching is **linear**: Apply → Wait → Reject → Repeat.

**BASIN::NEXUS** transforms it into a **closed-loop intelligence system**:

1. **ORACLE ARRAY (Discovery)** — Signal detection, VC portfolio scanning, predictive market analysis
2. **BATTLESTATION (Preparation)** — AI interview simulation, voice telemetry, objection handling
3. **BUILDER DECK (Execution)** — Pipeline CRM, negotiation scripts, first-90-day plans
