## 🎯 What This Is

**BASIN::NEXUS** is an AI-powered GTM Intelligence Platform that I built to operationalize my 15 years of revenue experience into code.

This isn't a "job search tool." It's a **Reverse-ATS** — a system that finds the hidden market, coaches your narrative, and eliminates operational friction from the job hunt.
