## 🎯 The Revenue Architect (Ex-Fudo Security, Google, Hewlett Packard, NetApp, SurveyMonkey & Sense)

I build data-driven GTM systems that bridge engineering complexity with commercial velocity. My focus is on scaling revenue by eliminating operational friction.

### 📈 Key Architectural Wins & Metrics

These are the verifiable systems I built and scaled, demonstrating the blend of technical rigor and commercial strategy:

| Role | Architectural Win | Metric |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fudo Security** | Re-architected global outbound motion & partner channel. | **160%** YoY Pipeline Increase |
| **Sense (Workforce AI)** | BDR team leadership & sales automation framework. | Generated **$10M in pipeline** & reduced customer churn by **12%**. |
| **Basin & Associates** | Zero-to-One GTM engines for AI/DevSecOps clients. | **$621k** Active Pipeline Generated. |

### 🧱 Foundational Rigor & Scale (Google Ops, MBA, Field Leadership)

My methods are grounded in process rigor and early leadership development:

| Foundation | Core Focus | Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SurveyMonkey** | **Enterprise Portfolio Management.** | Managed a **$300M+ enterprise portfolio** & closed **$300K** in expansion revenue. |
| **Sense (Enablement)** | **Social Selling Program Design.** | Increased sales team response rates by **125%**. |
| **Google** / **NetApp** | Operations Rigor & Process Optimization. | Drove a **15% increase** in operational efficiency (Google Shopping launch). |
| **HP / Early Career** | Field Sales Leadership & Player-Coach DNA. | Managed and trained a team of **20 associates** in product demonstration. |
