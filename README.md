## 🧪 THE THESIS (Why This Exists)

Traditional job searching is a **linear** process: Apply → Wait → Reject.

**BASIN::NEXUS** transforms it into a **cyclical, engineering-grade system**:

1. **Signal Detection (Oracle):** Predictive scanning of VC portfolios, ATS data, and economic indicators.
2. **Simulation (Digital Twin):** AI-driven roleplay to stress-test narratives against company-specific archetypes (NVIDIA, LinkedIn, eBay).
3. **Execution (Revenue OS):** Treating the career search as a measurable Enterprise Sales pipeline.

> *"I don't apply for jobs. I architect revenue systems—including the one that gets me hired."*
